Backend: First install (or setup links to) the Matlab runtime library in MCR/, following the instructions “get_matlab_runtime.txt”. Test the backend using “run/run_demo.sh MCR/v84/ static/test.png run/ 1 50 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1” (default is GPU mode, but has the automatic fallback using CPU mode). Take a look at “run/readme.txt” to see if you need to recompile the binary, or if problems encountered using the precompiled binary.

Frontend: Flask+gevent written in “app.py” and “templates/index.html”. Source images are directly placed and served in “static/” and the backend also directly reads and writes images from/into “static/”. Hacking multiple networks is now an easter egg, and can be turned on/off by adding “/adv” to the end of website’s URL. Add “/?taskid=TASKID” to fetch old task results. Still needs task queue for launching backend jobs, and a more scalable frontend.
