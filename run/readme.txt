Precompiled files are “demo” and “run_demo.sh”. In addition to the Matlab runtime library, CUDA 6.5 may be required as well, although directly creating symbolic links of libcudart.so.6.5 and libcublas.so.6.5 in /usr/lib/ from earlier versions (e.g. 5.5) also works.  However, for better performances, recompilation is highly recommended. In src/, first extract and compile “matconvnet-1.0-beta7.tar.gz” following the authors’ website http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/ (e.g. make ENABLE_GPU=y ARCH=glnxa64 MATLABROOT=/usr/local/MATLAB/R2014b CUDAROOT=/usr/local/cuda). Matlab version above R2014a would be better, though R2013a also works by configuring the Makefile. Add required Matlab’s paths (vl_setupnn) and test compiled functions (vl_test_nnlayers). Download required network mat files using “get_networks.sh”. Then add “minConf” to Matlab’s path. Follow “demo.m” to test if runnable (test.png in ../../static). If everything works, compile the binary using “mcc -m -R -nojvm -R -nodisplay -R -singleCompThread -v demo.m;”. “-R -singleCompThread” can be removed if multithread preferred. Once compiled, move “demo” and “run_demo.sh” into run/. Test the compiled binary following the main readme file.
