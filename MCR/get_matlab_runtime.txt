If you already have Matlab installed, you can simply create a symbolic link to the main directory of Matlab here (e.g. v84/ -> /usr/local/MATLAB/R2014b/). Otherwise, you can download (and remember to install, not just extract files from) the runtime library from http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/. Follow http://www.mathworks.com/help/compiler/working-with-the-mcr.html for instructions (e.g. non-interactive installation). To use the precompiled "demo" file directly, you will need to have the v84 (i.e. R2014b) version of Matlab or runtime library.
